Learning the ropes with LP problems

First Probelem - 
Diet problem - determine the cheapest combination of food that will satisfy all nutrition needs

3 food items (Food1, Food2, Food3)
2 Nutrients (Protein, Carbs)

Define the probelem
    List the costs of each food items
        Food1: 2$/Unit
        Food2: 3$/Unit
        Food3: 1$/Unit
    
    List the amount of each nutrient provided by each food
        Protein(g) - Food1: 3g, Food2: 2g, Food3: 1g
        Carbs(g) - Food1: 2g, Food2: 2g, Food3: 3g
        
    List the minimum required amount of each nutrient
        Atleast 10g of Protein
        Atleast 12g of Carbs
        
Set up the LP Problem
    Objective funtion [Minimize the cost]
    Define the constraints [Nutritional requirements]


Second Problem -
resource allocation problem - where the goal is to maximize profit
